##Description

This is Dino Jump game. It is a simple game with Dino as the main character and some cactus he has to avoid by jumping high in the sky! This was a good challenge because I had to find the assets for this game such as the background, the dino and the cactus. There is only one level at the moment, but I managed to collect some more assets to create several levels with different levels and difficulties. I'm proud of the shading I'm able to create to give the game some depth and how it flows or even when the game is lost, the colour change of the dino. The challenge of creating a perfect ribbon to give movement to the game was the biggest challenge!

##Instructions

If you are cloning this project, you will need

1 - VsCode with live server extension.

2 - Go live 

3 - Use the spacebar to jump!

4 - If you lose, press any key to start!

##Features

I would like to have a number of levels that start off easy and then increase in level, and have a goal at the start of the game to pass that level.

##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of Dino Jumop, I have included a package of screenshots and a video. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.

##ROADMAP

It would be cool to add multiple levels!
